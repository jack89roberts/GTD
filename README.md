# GTD

A look at the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), and my first time using pandas, sklearn and jupyter. Exploratory data analysis, using tf-idf type weights to identify characteristics of attacks by certain groups, and creating a model to try to assign an attack to a group based on its features.
